--  
Adressing all the issues from the original design, implementing improvements by yOPERO, Martin Zabojnik and others.

* Tougher parts (great ongoing work!):
 * Stronger holders for the linear bearings (vibration makes them slide away)
 * Reinforce screw holders
* Attachment for a vacuum cleaner
* Better scalability (particularly for the Y axis)
* Better spindle motor design:

 * Spindle speed control
* Integrated endstop holders
